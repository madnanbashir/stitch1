    You're set up with Stitch at <%= organizationName %>. The next step is to start communicating on Stitch with your team.
</p>
<p>
    To invite your colleagues, we've made a simple invite page:
</p>
<div class="btn-div">
    <a href="<%= inviteTeamUrl %>" class="myButton">
        Invite your team now!
    </a>
</div>
<div class="mail-hint">
    (At the link you'll be able to check who's already invited.)
</div>
